# Linear Regression 

*Fitting a plane to 3-D Points* - for higher dimensions, it's called **Hyperplane.***

$y = w_0 + w_1x_1+ w_2x_2+ w_3x_3+ ... + w_dx_d + \epsilon$

Here,
	$w_i$ is Unknown Parameter and  $\epsilon$  is **Irreducible Error***.


TRAINING DATA $\rightarrow$ LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL $\rightarrow$  ??



## Closed Form Solution :

Consider the $W^*$

$W^* = \text{argmin}_w \frac{1}{n} \Sigma_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - w_ix)^2 ...  \text{complete formula later}$

**Objective :** Transform the data points to a diff dimensionality to enable a better regressions fit - this is done using [Basis Function](obsidian://open?vault=Academics&file=IITB_Notes%2FAutumn_2024%2Fcs725_Foundations_of_Machine_Learning%2FBasis%20Function)
