Maths and Proofs are of these categories:
 1. **Construction**
 2. **Contradiction**
 3. **Induction**

**Question :** Prove that sum of first $n$-odd numbers is a perfect square.
--
**Proving by Induction :**

**Step 1: Base Case** - only first number - $1 = 1^2$

**Step 2** : **Induction Step** - $S_n = 1+3+5+\dots+2n-1 = k^2$



> many a times, in middle of a proof, one gets some more insights on how to improve, or why this solution won't work.
