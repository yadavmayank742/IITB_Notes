Maths and Proofs are of these categories:
 1. **Construction**
 2. **Contradiction**
 3. **Induction**

**Question :** Prove that sum of first $n$-odd numbers is a perfect square.
--
**Proving by Induction :**
**Step 1: Base Case** - only first number - $1 = 1^2$


> many a times, in middle of a proof, one gets some more insights on how to improve, or why this solution won't work.
